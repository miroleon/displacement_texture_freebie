# ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Displacement Texture Freebie Pack!

This GitHub repository offers a sample glimpse into the full Displacement Texture Pack available on Gumroad ([coming soon](https://miroleon.gumroad.com/)). For a Three.js tutorial on how to add a fractal glass distortion effect on top of a scene ([coming soon](https://www.youtube.com/@miroxleon)), I've created these seamless textures and decided to make them available. You can use this sample pack to follow along with the tutorial. If you want to support my work, you can get the full pack, which allows me to create more educational material and assets for everyone.

# ðŸ“¦ About This Pack
## This freebie pack contains
- Two carefully selected textures from the full version. One is for the **fractal glass distortion** effect, and the other one resembles a **photocopy texture**.
- All textures are **seamless** and **can easily be tiled**.
- Each texture is available in **1K**, **2K**, and **4K** to accommodate different performance and quality needs.
- All textures are available in **JPEG** and **PNG**. The 4K versions of the textures are also available as **PSD** files to be used with the displacement filter in Photoshop.
- All the textures are available in a **darker tone** (=normal) and an **inverted version** (=light)
- For web contexts, all resolutions are also available as **compressed JPEGs** for shorter loading times.
- A setup demonstrating how to implement these textures in a Three.js scene using custom shaders for displacement is also included. You can also refer to the **Codepen** version ([coming soon](https://codepen.io/miroleon)) to play around with the code.

## ðŸ”§ Usage
While I designed the textures for the Three.js Tutorial and their use in Photoshop, you can obviously use them in any context where a grayscale texture can be helpful. 

# ðŸ“˜ Additional Resources
- YouTube Tutorial: A detailed tutorial will soon be available, guiding you through the process of integrating these textures into your projects. This will be particularly helpful for those new to working with shaders and displacement maps.
- Codepen Template: For a hands-on learning experience, a Codepen template will be provided along with the YouTube tutorial.

# ðŸŒŸ Full Version Features
If you find the textures in this freebie pack useful, consider exploring the Full Displacement Texture Pack on Gumroad ([coming soon](https://miroleon.gumroad.com/)). It includes a much wider range of textures in all the variations that you can explore in the freebie, from 1K compressed JPEGs to 4K PSD files.

For the community on GitHub, I added a special 5% discount code:
